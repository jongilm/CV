## <a name="history">Career History:</a>

#### Sep 2019 to Present
**Senior Software Engineer (Crypto & Security): Quantinuum (previously known as Cambridge Quantum Computing Ltd), Cyber Security Division, London.**<br>
*Partnership House, Carlisle Place, 2nd Floor, London SW1P 1BX, United Kingdom*

Appointed as a member of the CQC Cyber Security Team to assist with the development of their IronBridge project delivering quantum sourced entropy to partners and third-party clients, and also offering implementations of the quantum-resistant (post-quantum) crypto algorithms currently being assessed by NIST.  My primary roll was that of middleware and server components in CPP, C, C# and JS, but soon grew to also encompass embedded software (primarily C) on a variety of Xilinx Zynq 7xxx FPGA/ARM devices.

Other areas of development include development of OpenSSL engine plugins to make IronBridge randomness available to applications and users via the standard OpenSSL API and command line tools.  The primary aspect of this involved acquiring the randomness from a remote IronBridge server/API using post-quantum KEM (Key Encapsulation), signing and PQ approved ciphers. One of the areas of application of this technology was in the secure take-on and communication between nodes in a Ethereum blockchain DLT - specifically evaluating the possibility of economically verifying a Falcon PQ Signature from within the blockchain by means of a smart contract implemented in Solidity - this was one of the key elements of a paper co-authored with the customer and subsequently published: Namely **arXiv:2106.06640 [quant-ph] "Quantum-resistance in blockchain networks"**, published 11-Jun-2021 https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2106.06640 .

I was a senior member of the small Cyber Engineering team that developed and launched **"Quantum Origin"** (https://www.quantinuum.com/cybersecurity/quantumorigin), delivering near-perfect randomness and, from that, best-in-class Post-Quantum and Classic keys to customers - which may have been the world's first commercial application of quantum computing. 


Areas of work/expertise:
- Full software Lifecycle, Windows and Linux, VMs and cross platform development, Code Quality.
- Implementation of Crypto-systems using existing algorithms, Documentation, Mentoring and general dissemination of knowledge.
- Networks and Networking

Tools and skills used include:
- Design, Development, Code Quality, Testing, Integration, Security.
- Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT/Blockchain), Ethereum, Solidity Smart-Contracts, Javascript, Node.js, RESTful API
- MongoDB, SqlServer, MySQL, Docker, AWS, Azure.
- git, GitHub/GitLab, Jira, Confluence, Linux, Bash.
- Agile, Slack, Zoom
- Open Source Software (OSS) and montoring of the currently approved algorithms by NIST

#### Aug 2017 to Jul 2019 (2 years)
**Software Engineer (Core): Calastone Ltd, Innovation/Blockchain Team, London City.**<br>

Appointed as a member of the Innovation Team to assist with the development of their enterprising DMI (Distributed Market Infrastructure) blockchain project for Managed Funds.  My primary roll on the team was to bring skills in software lifecycle, Agile, source control, architecture, software engineering disciplines and cross-platform knowledge, and of course, software development as I acquired knowledge of their chosen languages.
On joining the team, the product had just reached proof of concept level, developed using a CQRS/Event Sourcing model primarily in Typescript/Angular on Node.js and Solidity on Ethereum, using RabbitMQ and EventStore for the event stores and MongoDB for the read model, all running on Docker on AWS.  Over the following two years we (the Innovation Team) brought the system up to production level, migrating to SqlServer, Dotnet Core, Service Bus, and Kubernetes on Azure. As a prerequisite, we were guided through development and implementation of OAuth2/OpenID identity and claims providers as the corporate Single-Sign-On service.
The DMI system went through various restructures as the business and performance requirements changed and matured with time, with our Agile approach proving invaluable. The DMI system ultimately went live in May/June 2019, offering a few areas of new functionality for the clients on the Early Adopter Program, but more importantly creating a resilient, robust and secure platform and Blockchain/DLT framework on which future products could be built.
As the platform was approaching launch, there was another major project being moth-balled, so the company was down-sizing its engineering department. My role having been largely completed, I took advantage of this opportunity to seek new pastures.
